<h2>Basic Operation</h2>

<p>The AG-106 provides 6 two-input AND gates. It is designed to take digital signals, but it will happily accept analog signals. </p>

<h2>Signal Range</h2>

<p>The voltage range of the digital gates can be configured from the context menu. The device will output at the full range of the configured settings. The inputs will measure a logical high signal anywhere above the midpoint of the configured range.</p>

<h2>Normalling</h2>

<p>Any output not connected will be normalled into a third input on the gate below. In this way multi-input gates can be created up to a maximum of 12 inputs. </p>

<p>An input not connected will be ignored.</p>

<h2>AG-104</h2>

<p>The AG-104 provides four two-input AND gates in a small form factor. Otherwise functionality is as for the AG-106 above.</p>

<h2>AG-202</h2>

<p>The AG-202 provides two four-input polyphonic AND gates in a small form factor. The number of output channels matches the number of channels in the first input.</p>
