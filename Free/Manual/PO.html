<h2>Basic Operation</h2>

<p>The PO-101 and PO-102 devices are digital oscillators which offer a choice of 5 waveforms and provide 20 outputs at different phases. The pitch can be adjusted using the TUNE and FINE knobs, and the associated CV input.</p>

<p>16 fixed phase outputs are provided, dividing the cycle into 12 and 8 equal parts. In addition 4 further adjustable phase outputs are provided. The phase of these outputs can be controlled using a control knob, and/or an associated CV input.</p>

<h4>PO-204 Phase Modulation Engine</h4>

<h2>Basic Operation</h2>

<p>The PO-204 does not offer the wealth of fixed phase outputs, instead it offers a greater level of control over 4 output signals from the same oscillator. Each of the 4 outputs can be adjusted independantly while remaining in tune with the master tuning controls. This can be used in conjunction with envelope generators to produce a Yamaha style FM [sic] synthesiser.</p>

<h2>Phase</h2>

<p>The phase of the output can be adjusted using the PHASE control knob and associated CV.</p>

<h2>Waveform</h2>

<p>The waveform of the output can be adjusted using the WAVE control knob and associated CV. The PO-204 has 5 basic waveforms and the WAVE control allows you to blend anywhere between any pair of the basic forms.</p>

<h2>Frequency multiplier</h2>

<p>The output frequency can be multiplied by an integer value from 1 to 16 using the MULT control knob and associated CV.</p>
