<h2>Basic Operation</h2>

<p>The NG-112 provides 12 NOT gates. It is designed to take digital signals, but it will happily accept analog signals. </p>

<h2>Signal Range</h2>

<p>The voltage range of the digital gates can be configured from the context menu. The device will output at the full range of the configured settings. The inputs will measure a logical high signal anywhere above the midpoint of the configured range.</p>

<h2>Normalling</h2>

<p>Any input not connected will cause a high signal at the corresponding output. The NG-112 can be used with inputs disconnected to provide stable 1V, 5V or 10V signals.</p>

<p>By connected a single output to the input of another gate, it is possible to generate stable 0V, -5V and -10V signals.</p>

<h2>NG-106</h2>

<p>The NG-106 provides six NOT gates in a small form factor. Otherwise functionality is as for the NG-112 above.</p>

<h2>NG-202</h2>

<p>The NG-202 provides six polyphonic NOT gates in a small form factor.</p>
