<h1>Hi-Resolution Storage Scope</h1>

<h4>HS-101 Hi-Res Storage Scope</h4>

<p><img src="HS-101.png" alt="View of the Storage Scope" title="Hi-Res Storage Scope" /></p>

<h2>Basic Operation</h2>

<p>The storage scope takes a single input signal and when triggered, records that signal for a fixed period of time. Once storage is complete, the stored signal can be viewed on the display. </p>

<p>The scope can store up to 64 seconds of data, even at 768KHz.</p>

<h2>Trigger</h2>

<p>The scope can be triggered either by a gate or trigger pulse to the TRIGGER input, or by manually pressing the STORE button. Once triggered, a 1 ms 10V pulse is sent through the TRIGGER output, allowing multiple HS-101 devices to be synchronised, even when manually triggered.</p>

<h2>Length</h2>

<p>The LENGTH knob will adjust the storage time resolution of the scope. The length of the storage buffer can be adjusted from 1 thousandth of a second up to 64 seconds.</p>

<h2>Viewing</h2>

<p>The X and Y ZOOM and PAN controls allow you to choose which part of the signal you wish to view. While viewing, a tooltip on the cursor will give details of the part of the image that you are examining.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Voltage value at the point on the display under the cursor</li>
<li>The current time since the trigger, at the point on the display under the cursor</li>
<li>The current sample at the point on the display under the cursor</li>
<li>The Voltage of the stored signal at the point in time under the cursor.</li>
</ul>

<p>When zoomed out, where several samples are under the cursor, the signal voltage may be indicated by a minimum and maximum range rather than a single value.</p>
